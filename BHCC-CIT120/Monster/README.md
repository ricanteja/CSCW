# Monster
This program was for a CS college course. The lab was given the pet name "Monster" by my professor because of it's challenging nature, she said.

The program is basically a obstacle course demonstrating various programming abilities and use of good logic like input validation etc.

There are 7 different functions that the program can do and these are:

1) Average a set of non-negative numbers - You will be prompted to continuously enter numbers until you enter a number which is less than zero. The average of the numbers you entered will be printed after.

2) Enter a number in a given range - You will be prompted to enter a start and an end range and then a number in the range you entered. The program is written in such a way to make the case where your start is larger than your end impossible.

3) Enter a letter - Pretty straight forward. The program will make sure you enter a letter.

4) Enter an integer - Also very straight forward. The program will check the input before accepting it (or crashing).

5) Enter a prime number - You will be prompted to input a prime number and the program will validate that it is indeed prime.

6) Classify a number as deficient, perfect, or abundant. A number is deficient when the sum of all it's factors is less than the number itself, perfect when the sum of the factors equal the number and abundant when the sum of the factors is greater than the number. This is of course not including the number itself in the sum of the factors.

7) Prints the ASCII table with customizable formatting. You can choose the number of columns you want and the program takes care of the rest.
