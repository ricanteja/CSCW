# Computer Science Course Work
Sharing the projects which I have made for school.

## Bunker Hill Community College

BHCC-CIT120 was an introductory course focusing on C++ and the fundamentals. The class wasn't much of a challenge for me because I had been programming as a hobbyist in C/C++ for years before I even got into college making small games and other things. This course had no C++ classes, templates, containers or data structures however these are all things which I had used for pet projects. The class focused on functions and logic with some file I/O sprinkled in.

BHCC-CIT239 was focused on Java shifting towards JavaFX near the end of the course. This class did cover more advanced topics which are common to high-level languages. Some of the topics covered were class objects, inheritance, variable-length containers, exception handling, lambda expressions, file I/O and of course JavaFX. The ability to create windows and draw things really got me excited for JavaFX and I soaked it like a sponge.

## Georgia State University
