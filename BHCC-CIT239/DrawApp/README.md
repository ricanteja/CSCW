# DrawApp
This program was for a CS college course.

This is a simple graphic program written with JavaFX and was one of the final projects for the course.

Being the over-achiever that I am I added multiple colors. Simply clicking on the color will change the color lines that are drawn. To draw a line move the cursor with the arrow-keys.
