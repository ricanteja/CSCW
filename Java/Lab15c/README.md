This program was for a CS college course. This program uses JavaFX to animate a pendulum swinging. The user has control to speed up the animation, slow it down and pause it.

The controls are:

Up arrow to speed up the animation

Down arrow to slow down the animation

Mouse click to pause the animation


Note: The animation does not stop if rate becomes 0!
