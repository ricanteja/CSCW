# Lab12a
This program was for a CS college course.

This program detects words inside of text files. The program works from the command line and should be invoked with the arguments, e.g [java Lab12a for Gettysburg.txt]

[java Lab12a WORD TEXT_FILE]
WORD being the word you want to search for and TEXT_FILE the file in which you want to search.

This was a demonstration of command line arguments in Java, which I quickly recognized from programming in C.

The IntelliJ IDEA project included has the command line arguments set to "and TestData.txt"
